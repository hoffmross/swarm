Remaining issues:

-adv only follow first agent atm
-might need more epochs, very computationally intensive atm, no gpu support
-error function most likely needs more tuning
	-reward keeping agents at goal
-adversaries are too slow

Analysis:

-higher percentages of leaders perform much better 40% 
-saw some good performance in 20% but less common
-larger leader percentages were able to avoid the adv and keep them in the goal radius


Experiments:
